# Code

## Building

You'll need to add a bunch of libraries in the arduino library manager:

* M5Stack by M5Stack
* M5Core2 by M5Stack
* lv_arduino by Gabor Kiss-Vamosi
  * Maybe these aren't required anymore?
  * lvgl by kisvegabor
  * lv_examples by kisvegabor
* TFT_eSPI by Bodmer
* And probably a few more I've forgotten. Good luck!
