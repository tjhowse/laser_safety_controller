# Code

## Building

You'll need to add a bunch of libraries in the arduino library manager:

* M5Stack by M5Stack
* M5Core2 by M5Stack
* lv_arduino by Gabor Kiss-Vamosi
* TFT_eSPI by Bodmer
* OneWire by Jim Studt et al
* DallasTemperature by Miles Burton et al
* ESP32Encoder by Kevin Harrington
* And probably a few more I've forgotten. Good luck!
